	Abstract = {Data integration is the problem of combining data residing
	at different sources, and providing the user with a unified
	view of these data. The problem of designing data integra-
	tion systems is important in current real world applications,
	and is characterized by a number of issues that are interest-
	ing from a theoretical point of view. This document presents
	on overview of the material to be presented in a tutorial on
	data integration. The tutorial is focused on some of the the-
	oretical issues that are relevant for data integration. Special
	attention will be devoted to the following aspects: modeling
	a data integration application, processing queries in data
	integration, dealing with inconsistent data sources, and rea-
	soning on queries.},

	Abstract = {Data stored outside Web pages and accessible
	from the Web, typically through HTML forms, consitute
	the so-called Deep Web. Such data are of great value, but
	difficult to query and search. We survey techniques to optimize
	query processing on the Deep Web, in a setting where
	data are represented in the relational model. We illustrate
	optimizations both at query plan generation time and at
	runtime, highlighting the role of integrity constraints. We
	discuss several prototype systems that address the query
	processing problem.},
